# Recobook

Implemented a Recommender system to suggest books based on the book you like. 
Used the data provided at http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/

I used an item-item collaborative filtering approch and returned top 5 most matched books for the input book.
Made a website in flask that connects to the backend postgres server and fetches the result.
